Essentially, all ggplot2 geometries and operations can be utilized in ComplexHeatmap through the eheat package,  with the exception of facet operations (and you shouldn’t do it in eheat package). Fortunately, ComplexHeatmap is capable of handling these operations independently, rendering them unnecessary.

","A 'ggplot2' extension offers various tools the creation of complex, multi-plot visualizations. Built on the familiar grammar of graphics, it provides intuitive tools to align and organize plots, making it ideal for complex visualizations. It excels in multi-omics research—such as genomics and microbiomes—by simplifying the visualization of intricate relationships between datasets, for example, linking genes to pathways. Whether you need to stack plots, arrange them around a central figure, or use a circular layout, 'ggalign' delivers flexibility and accuracy with minimal effort.
